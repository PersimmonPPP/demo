1) 
the code is trying to search for rows containing "color" in the file 
"hwl_test.txt", translating spacebar into a new line, output 8 rows in
command window
2)
the "*color" should be "included" with quotes rather than a "*"
5)	
This
is
a
very
colorful

it's said the "README.md" is modified, but I'm not sure if this is the output
I should get, as I go directly to the "git push" command without thinking
before using the "git status" command.

identify the sequence and have a new variable storing it, called "seq"
have a counter of G and C, naming "GC"
have a counter of the total, naming "total"
have a while loop that ends when encountering a spacebar or a new line
in the while loop, every time we read a character, if it's a "G" or "C," we 
have "GC"+=1 and "total"+=1; otherwise, we only have "total" +=1
display the pencentage, which is "GC"/"total"
